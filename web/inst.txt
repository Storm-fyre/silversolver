I need to add few significant updates. Its more like a full overhaul.
Currently the web app just gives its own suggestions for us to try and takes feedback. I need this web app to give a choice to us to even type a word. after I type the word and give the feedback it will give its next suggestion, I can either accept that suggestion or I can again give my own word.
I also want to add a back option so that after it pressed everything goes a step back like notjing happened.
May be we can add 2 small buttons below the main action button, left one being "Back" and right one being "Edit".
Do not give me code yet. tell me in absolute detail what you understood. if your understanding is correct, then I will ask you to give the code.
